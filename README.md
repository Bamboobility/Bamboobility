## Welcome to Bamboobility! 

Bamboobility is an *open-source initiative* that aims to enable the creation of a low-tech wheelchair that is accessible to all people, regardless of geographic or economic constraints.

The project focuses on affordability, simplicity, and accessibility. The wheelchair is designed as a *DIY build*, using low-cost materials and simple tools that are widely available, making it possible to reproduce and repair in low-resource contexts.

Developed at the *RWTH Aachen University* in collaboration with the *Swiss association Roll On*, Bamboobility places special emphasis on the use of bamboo, an abundant, renewable, and locally available material in many regions of the world. Bamboo’s strength, flexibility, and sustainability make it a suitable core material for a robust and repairable wheelchair design.

As an open-source project, Bamboobility actively encourages discussion, experimentation, and shared improvements. Builders, users, engineers, designers, and communities are invited to contribute on this Repository their ideas, adaptations, and refinements, ensuring that the wheelchair can continuously evolve to better meet real-world needs.

Please make sure to upload your files at least also in English to enable the world-wide application!
